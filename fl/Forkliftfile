# This is the list of packages that are required to build
# the package. If your build dependency doesn't exist.
# Please donate it, or open an issue:
# https://github.com/forklift-packages/meta-requests/issue

build-dependencies:
  - go:  ^1.3
  - git: ^1.9

# This section is run before building the package
# on build system.
build:
  - mkdir -p root/bin root/etc/forklift/installed
  - go build -o root/bin/fl github.com/forklift/fl/cli

# This section is run after building the package, whatever 
# the build faild or successed, so write your clean commands
# in graceful. (They shouldn't assume a successful build.)
# You can also run `fl clean` to do, for example a, clean up 
# after fixing a cleanup failur.

clean:
  - rm -rf root src


# Right now, there isn't much about package type but
# please specify one that applies.
#
# lib:         A shared library.
#
# application: Any program used by user, like a text editor
#              or a network manager.
#
# service:     Any program that provides a services, like a
#              web server or ssh server.
#
# config:      This package provides configurations, it is allowed
#              to override the base package files. Package name must
#              be [base]-config. eg: nginx-config for package nginx.
#              Discuss: issue/URL. TODO:!!
type: system

main: bin/fl

# only, do NOT list base package dependncies here.

dependencies:

# The package files.
# You must also list all files that are expected to be produced
# during build.
files:
 - bin/fl
 - etc/forklift/
 - etc/forklift/installed/



# This section is run after the package
# files are copied on system.
# So you may call the package binaries
# if you need to, see Busybox package for
# a better reference.

install:
  - echo "No post install needed. Happy Forklifting!"

# This section is run before the package
# files are removed from system.
# So you may call the package binaries
# if you need to for clean up.

# Do not delete the package files, they are
# handled by the package manger, removing any
# package file will result into warnnings.

 - mkdir -p /etc/installed-packages/
 - cp -r etc/forklift/installed etc/installed-packages

 - echo "You may remove the folder."
